## Icebox Features
* I want to add multiple trim levels for each model such as the Dodge Challenger R/T or the Dodge Challenger Hellcat.
* I would like to create links in the navbar to allow users to switch to each model easily
* I would like to create more specific color options for each vehicle as they all technically have their own color names
* Allow users to post images for each post
* Create user authentification so only the user who posted a comment can delete or update that same comment
